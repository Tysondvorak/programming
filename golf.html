        <h3>Clubs</h3>
        <p>If you want to take up golf as a hobby, I would suggest getting clubs. Here is a picture of some really nice clubs.</p>

        <p>I personally wouldnt buy these clubs because they are several thousand dollars, but if that what you want go ahead. I would start with some used clubs or your parents old clubs.</p>
